## Research question:

Q1: How do we define winter length (the obligate period over which a species must 
hibernate)?

Q2: Do traits (such as body fat) vary spatially to account for local differences in 
hibernation need?

## Q1
#Data required
- hibernation length data (durationData.csv)
	-literature
	-grey literature
	-data from collaborators
		-winter duration part 1 from Jason/ Cori
		-"winter length of far northwest NA.xls"
	*Notes:
		* many people have activity data for when bats leave maternity roost for the year, 
		can we take that and assume that they go into hibernation then or do they go 
		to swarming. If so, is that a relatively predicable length of time?		
		* There are commonly unmatched data (and entry or exit point is missing), is there
		a way to interpret that missing data either through nearest neighbour or some 
		other mechanism?
- Spatial Layers:
	-Estimations of winter length
	-Elevation, Northing covariates
		
##Process
- Clean records for Jason
	-munge/recordMunge 
	*winterDurationClean.csv
- Create spatial co-variate layers to 1k and match resolution and projection 
	-munge/geoMunge
	*wintor_aux files. 
- Linear Regressions [wintorLM.R]
	-f1 contains only one of the potential covariates
	-f2 Northing plus covariates
	-f3 Northing plus DEM plus covariates
	-model selection through AIC
